    <p>The <i> PS3 </i> is a home video game console developed by Sony in 2007. The <i> PS3 </i> released fully in Japan on November 11, 2006, in North America on November 17, 2006, and in Europe and Australia on March 23, 2007. The console’s main rivals at the time were the “Xbox 360” of Microsoft, and the “Wii” of Nintendo. All consoles were part of the “seventh generation” of such devices. The <i>  PS3 </i> had an exciting new feature compared to its older counterparts- online gaming. The <i> PS3 </i> opened a new world of possibilities with its social interface. Players could now interact with each other across the world on their <i>  PS3’s. </i>  However, the <i> PS3 </i> had a slow market start. It came out with mixed reviews, being described as having “untapped potential”. The main criticism was its price, ranging from 600$USD-500$USD, and its general lack of variety in games. Its view became more positive over time though, especially with the release of the “slim” version. The <i> PS3 </i> ultimately halted production in May 2017 in Japan, the last place to still be producing such consoles. Despite its hardships, the console hosted many majorly successful games. These games include “Sonic the Hedgehog”, “Virtual Fighter V”, and “Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion”. Games like these secured the console a positive review. The <i> PS3 </i>  was also unique due to is 3D capabilities: users could now experience some of their favorite games more vividly. </p>
