      Sony came out with yet another console, the <i> PS4 </i>. It was released in Japan on February 22, 2014, November 13, 2013, in North America, and November 29, 2013 in Europe, South America and Australia. As a console of the eight generation, it competed with the “Xbox One” from Microsoft, and the “Switch” and “Wii U” from Nintendo. The PS4 was the most powerful PlayStation yet, being created with an AMD Accelerated Processing Unit, which could peak at 1.8 teraflops. It was praised in comparison with its competitors, such as the “Xbox One” for this power. The console featured “Share Play”, a feature where you could stream your gameplay online to friends. The <i> PS4  </i> was more lenient with its digital licensing, allowing more third-party developers to create game for the device. The PS4 featured a PlayStation online store, allowing users to buy video games remotely, rather than having to go through the inconvenience of a physical copy. In October 2019, The <i> PS4 </i> became the second bestselling household console of all time, behind its predecessor- the PS2. The PlayStation 4 also released a slim version as its older counterparts did- which was very popular.  PlayStation also released the PlayStation 4 Pro, which featured an improved GPU and CPU clock rate, supporting a higher framerate and 4k resolution in game.
