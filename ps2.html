    <p>The <i> PS2 </i>  was the second installment of the PlayStation video console series. The <i> PS2 </i> was initially released in Japan on March 4, 2000, North America on October 26, 2000, Europe on November 24, 2000, and in Australia on November 30, 2000. By the time the <i> PS2 </i> released, there was already a strong community backing it up. Rather than a humble group of people building the console, there was now a dedicated team at Sony, working hard to produce a console that would live up to its predecessor. With over 4,000 game titles released on the console and over 1.5 billion copies sold, the console met the standards of the PS1 and exceeded them. The<i> PS2 </i>was such a big success, that it continued production until 12 years after its initial release- the longest time after release any video game console was produced. The console still had gamed being created for it up until the moment it was discontinued. Final repair services for the console discontinued in Japan on September 17, 2018- 18 years after release.  The <i>PS2</i> was created in three main forms- the original “fat” design, the “slimline” design of late 2004, and in 2010 Sony released a 22” TV with a <i>PS2 </i>already attached to it. The controller was mostly the same as the PS1 controller, with a slightly more sensitive design and two more levels of vibration. The<i> PS2</i> lived up to its predecessor, and even marked the beginning of its own franchise: The Grand Theft Auto franchise. The first game in the Grand Theft Auto series was released for this console, “Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas”.  </p>
