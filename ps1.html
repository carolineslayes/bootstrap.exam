    <p>The <i>PS1</i> is the first video game console created by Sony, <i>PS1</i> standing for “PlayStation 1”. Released first in Japan on December 3, 1994, and later in America on September 9, 1995, the <i>PS1</i> became the cornerstone of one of the most influential video game console series. The console hosted many popular games such as “Silent Hill”, “Madden NFL 2001”, and “Resident Evil”. The wide variety of games available on the console was one of the most attractive aspects of the device. The <i>PS1</i> was primarily developed by Ken Kutaragi in Japan in the early 1990’s. His interest in game development stemmed primarily from watching his daughter play video games as a child, specifically ones of the Nintendo. The PS1 placed unique emphasis on 3D pixels, a modern approach to video games for the time. After its release, PlayStation was very open and streamlined, encouraging third party developers to work on improving the console and its games. The PlayStation was incredibly popular, thanks to its vast game library and relatively low market price, at 299$ USD. The <i>PS1</i> became the first console to sell over 100 million units. The <i>PS1</i> grew a strong fanbase and community, setting it up for a line of thriving successors. The more modern PlayStations still follow the basic model and idea of the <i>PS1</i>, over 30 years later. The staff of “Next Generation” rated the console a 4.5 out of 5 stars, noting that “To succeed in this extremely cut-throat market, you need a combination of great hardware, great games, and great marketing. Whether by skill, luck, or just deep pockets, Sony has scored three out of three in the first salvo of this war”. </p>
